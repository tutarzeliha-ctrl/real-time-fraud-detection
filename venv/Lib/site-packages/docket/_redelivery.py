"""How a worker keeps its own messages and finds ones another worker abandoned.

A worker keeps a message by renewing its lease: XCLAIM with ``idle=0`` resets
the message's idle clock, so the sweep below does not take it away while the
task is still running.  A renewal names every message the worker holds, so it
goes out in chunks of at most ``LEASE_RENEWAL_BATCH`` ids, and it asks for
JUSTID.  A plain XCLAIM answers with the whole body of every message, and Redis
blocks while it builds that reply for a worker that discards it.

A worker sweeps its consumer group's pending list with XAUTOCLAIM to find
messages that another worker left behind.  ``RedeliverySweep`` owns that claim:
it bounds each call, keeps the cursor across calls, and creates the consumer
group again when Redis reports it missing.

Each call claims at most the worker's ``message_batch`` entries, so Redis reads
at most about ten times that many entries of the pending list per call.  The
cost of one call stays bounded however long the list grows.

Each call starts where the last one stopped.  A sweep that always restarted at
``0-0`` would never read the entries past its first window, so those could
never be redelivered.  The sweep keeps the cursor that XAUTOCLAIM returns.
Redis returns the cursor ``0-0`` at the end of the pending list, and the next
call then starts a fresh sweep from the front.

Walking the whole pending list once reads O(pending list) entries, so sweeping
on every poll pass pins Redis once that list grows large.  A worker sweeps on a
timer instead, at a quarter of the redelivery timeout.  Each wait is jittered by
``JITTER`` so a fleet that started together does not sweep in lockstep.  An
abandoned message therefore waits at most about a jittered quarter of the
timeout beyond the timeout itself before a sweep reclaims it.

One sweep costs O(pending list) no matter how many workers run, so the fleet
sweeps once per interval rather than once per worker.  When a worker's timer
elapses it takes a fleet-wide lease with ``SET {docket}:leases:redelivery-sweep
<worker> NX PX <interval>``, and only the worker holding the lease sweeps.  The
holder keeps it: it refreshes the lease on every pass while its sweep is under
way, so the lease covers the whole sweep and one worker sweeps at a time even
on a long pending list.  A worker whose timer fires while its own lease is
still live keeps that lease, rather than losing the sweep to itself.  Nobody
deletes the lease; it expires one interval after its last refresh, and that
expiry is what paces the fleet to at most one sweep per interval.  A worker
whose lease lapses mid-walk keeps its place in the walk and takes the lease
again when it can: at once if nobody else has it, or after resting if another
worker took it, so that worker can walk the list alone.

Once a sweep is under way the worker sweeps on every pass until the cursor
returns to the front.  Each pass claims no more entries than the worker has
free slots, and no more than its ``message_batch``, so a long pending list
takes many passes to walk.

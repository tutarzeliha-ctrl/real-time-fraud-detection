"""Redis Sentinel support for docket's ``redis+sentinel://`` URLs.

This module is the single point of Sentinel-awareness: URL parsing, the parsed
configuration, the connection pool that resolves the master through the Sentinel
daemons, and the tight TCP keepalive defaults that let a silently-dead master be
noticed promptly.  ``_redis.py`` only detects the scheme and dispatches here.

# sends a FIN/RST — would leave a blocked XREADGROUP waiting on the OS-default
# TCP keepalive (~2 hours on Linux) while Sentinel completes failover in seconds.
# We build the Sentinel pool ourselves, so we pin tight keepalive probes here: a
# dead peer is noticed in roughly TCP_KEEPIDLE + TCP_KEEPCNT * TCP_KEEPINTVL
# seconds.  The probes only fire on an otherwise-idle socket and a healthy peer
# answers them, so they don't disturb a legitimately long blocking read — which
# is exactly why disabling the read timeout is safe.  These match redis-py 8.0's
# own defaults; pinning them keeps the behaviour identical on the older redis-py
